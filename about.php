                  Phenomix Sciences is a comprehensive, data driven platform that brings precision medicine to obesity management. Our first product, licensed from the Mayo Clinic, is a novel blood test supported with an AI-driven algorithm that classifies the unique pathophysiological phenotype of patients with obesity. This disruptive new approach can be applied clinically to individualize therapy selections and improve overall weight-loss outcomes.

                  <strong>ABOUT US</strong><br>
                  Phenomix Sciences was established in Rochester, MN in 2017 by two leading NIH-funded obesity experts, Dr. Andres Acosta and Dr. Michael Camilleri.<br>
                  In early 2019, we established a start of the art facility located in University Enterprise Laboratories in St. Paul, MN. Our space is equipped with the latest platforms for metabolomic, genomic, and hormonal testing, as well as biobanking facilities to support the development and validation of the PhenoTest under strict adherence to regulatory guidelines. With the CLIA-accreditation process underway, we are anticipating launch of the PhenoTest by early 2020.
